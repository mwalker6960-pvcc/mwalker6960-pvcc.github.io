		<h1>Hello World</h1>
		<p>This isn't my first webpage.</p>
		<p>
			While this isn't my first webpage, I actually know very little html. 
I'm much more comfortable with Java, Python or even C++. With that said,
 here we go! I am pro GNU/Linux and FOSS (Free Open Source Software). 
Check out some of my links.</p>

		    <li>If you really want to make it in this space, you must deeply 
expand your knowledge of Operating Systems. Windows and MacOS are great 
for what they excel at, however; the guts of the digital world run on 
Unix based operating systems. Learning is all but required if you want 
to succeed! You can trust me. ;)</li>
